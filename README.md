## Overview
GBMPurity is a machine learning model designed to estimate the purity of bulk RNA-seq primary IDH-wildtype Glioblastoma (GBM) samples. In this context, purity refers to the proportion of malignant cells within a tumour sample.

Our model is a multi-layer perceptron trained on simulated pseudobulk tumours of known purity. These simulations were created using the GBmap single-cell resource ([Ruiz-Moreno et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.27.505439)).

For a detailed description of GBMPurity's architecture, training methodology, and performance metrics, please refer to our [preprint]([https://www.biorxiv.org/](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.11.602650v1)).

We have made this tool available as an easy-to-use web application at https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk/.

However, if you would like to run GBMPurity locally or access the PyTorch model, following the installation instructions below.




## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GBMPurity.git
    cd GBMPurity
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd GBMPurity
    ```

3. Create and activate the conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```


## Usage
### Data Preparation
Ensure that your input data meets the required format as described.

### Inference on bulk samples
To run inference on bulk samples organised in a matrix as described above, run the following command (replace the -d argument with the path to your data):
```bash
python src/GBMPurity.py -d /path/to/your/data.csv
```
### Access GBMPurity model
You can access the PyTorch model in the directory ```GBMPurity/model/GBMPurity.pt```

## Development and Support

GBMPurity is a product of the Glioma Genomics group at the University of Leeds.
